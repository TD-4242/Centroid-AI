# Centroid CNC12 Router Operation

## When to use / when not

Use this skill for **operating** Centroid CNC12 Router software on **Acorn, AcornSix, or
Hickory**: the main screen and F1-F10 menus, machine home, the hardware jog panel / MPG / VCP /
keyboard interface, setting part zeros and Work Coordinate Systems, the offset and tool
libraries, running/canceling/resuming jobs, and the Utility menu -- plus looking up any router
G-code, M-code, machine parameter, or CNC12 message by number. It is a faithful, generic capture
of the official **CNC12 Router Operators Manual** (v5.42+) -- not specific to any one machine.

**Do not use this skill** for Acorn hardware installation, wiring, or Wizard configuration -- see
the Acorn Installation Manual (Acorn Install ch.5, p.35; ch.6, p.71).

**Do not use this skill** for PLC stage-language (`.src`) programming or macro-to-PLC interaction
-- if the centroid-plc plugin is installed, see `centroid-plc-programming`; otherwise (PLC Manual, PDF p.13).

## Essentials

CNC12 Router installs to `c:\cncr` (Router Manual §1.8, p.13). On startup, before any job can
run, machine home must be set: if the machine has home/limit switches, reference marks, or safe
hard stops, `CYCLE START` runs the homing G-codes in `cncm.hom` from `c:\cncr`; by default that
file homes Z plus, then X minus, then Y plus (Router Manual §1.8, p.13). The Acorn Wizard
generates `cncm.hom` from its homing settings (Pairing Guide p.39).

The Options Window offers ten F1-F10 menus from the main screen (Router Manual §1.5, p.11):

| F-key | Menu |
| --- | --- |
| `F1` | Set Part Zeros |
| `F2` | Load Job |
| `F3` | MDI |
| `F4` | Run Job Options |
| `F5` | Tool/ATC |
| `F6` | Edit G-Code |
| `F7` | Utility |
| `F8` | Graph |
| `F9` | Smoothing |
| `F10` | Shut Down |

See [interface.md](reference/interface.md) for each menu's own sub-keys and full detail.

## Reference router

| Reference file | Look here when... |
| --- | --- |
| [reference/interface.md](reference/interface.md) | You need the DRO/message/status window layout, the machine-home procedure, or the F1-F10 main-screen menu map and each menu's sub-keys |
| [reference/operator-panel.md](reference/operator-panel.md) | You need the hardware jog panel button functions, the default VCP button legend, or the keyboard jog panel and keyboard shortcut keys |
| [reference/part-setup.md](reference/part-setup.md) | You're setting part zeros (manually, by laser, by probe, or by touch plate), configuring Work Coordinate Systems, Coordinate System Rotation (CSR), or Transformed WCS |
| [reference/tool-setup.md](reference/tool-setup.md) | You're working with the Offset Library (H/D values), the Tool Library, Tool Life Management, or PWM laser/spindle output setup |
| [reference/running-jobs.md](reference/running-jobs.md) | You're starting, canceling, or resuming a job; using the Run menu, Power Feed, or the communications stress test; or navigating the Utility menu |
| [reference/g-code-index.md](reference/g-code-index.md) | You need to look up a router G-code by number |
| [reference/m-code-index.md](reference/m-code-index.md) | You need to look up a router M-code by number |
| [reference/parameter-index.md](reference/parameter-index.md) | You need to look up a machine parameter by number |
| [reference/messages-index.md](reference/messages-index.md) | You need to look up a CNC12 status or error message by number |

The G-code, M-code, machine parameter, and CNC12 message indexes above are complete for the
chapters they cover -- G-codes (Router Manual Ch 12), M-codes (Ch 13), machine parameters (§15.7),
and CNC12 messages (Ch 16) -- not for the whole manual.

## Manuals

This skill cites: Router Manual (CNC12 Router Operators Manual), Acorn Install (Acorn Installation
Manual), Pairing Guide (Acorn Axis Pairing and Squaring), PLC Manual (CNC12 PLC Programming
Manual), VCP Manual (VCP 2.0 Users Manual). Router Manual and Acorn Install citations are printed
pages (PDF page = printed + 1); Pairing Guide and VCP Manual printed pages equal PDF pages; PLC
Manual citations are PDF pages. Exact wording is in the official PDF. When an answer needs text
beyond these references, run `python3 <plugin>/scripts/fetch_manual.py <id>` with `router-manual`,
`acorn-install`, `pairing-guide`, `plc-manual` or `vcp-manual` (`<plugin>` is this plugin's root
directory):

- exit 0: it printed the local PDF path — read the cited page with `pdftotext -layout -f <p> -l <p> <path> -`
  if available, or open the PDF.
- exit 4: not downloaded yet. Ask the user in plain words, e.g. "This is best checked against
  Centroid's CNC12 Router Operators Manual (free PDF, about 63 MB). Want me to download it to
  `~/.centroid-ai/manuals/`? I can also do this automatically from now on, or never ask
  again." Yes → rerun with `--yes`. "Always" → `python3 <plugin>/scripts/centroid_config.py set manuals.autoDownload always`, then rerun. "Never" → set `never`.
- exit 5: the user chose never to download; answer from the references and give the manual and page.
- exit 1: download failed; give the user the printed URL to download by hand.
