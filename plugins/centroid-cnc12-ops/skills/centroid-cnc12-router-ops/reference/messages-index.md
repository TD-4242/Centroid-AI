Abnormal stops are detected in this order: PLC, servo drive, spindle drive, lube, then ESTOP
(Router Manual §16.4, p.437).

| Code | Message | Meaning | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| 401 | PLC failure detected | MPU11 stopped with PLC failure bit set; job cancelled. Action: check PLC fibers and PLC logic power. | §16.4, p.437 |
| 404 | Spindle drive fault detected | MPU11 stopped with spindle drive fault bit set; job cancelled. Action: check the inverter for a fault or reset the spindle contactor OCR, then cycle the EMERGENCY STOP. | §16.4, p.438 |
| 405 | Lubricant level low | MPU11 stopped with low lube fault bit set; the current job finishes but nothing works after that. Action: add lube or check the low lube switch wiring, then cycle the EMERGENCY STOP. | §16.4, p.438 |

| 407 | limit (#__) tripped | MPU11 stopped with a limit switch tripped; job cancelled. Action: clear the limit switch. | §16.4, p.438 |
| 408 | Programmed action timer expired | M103's time expired before M104 was encountered; job cancelled. Action: find out why the timer expired before the specified action was completed. | §16.4, p.438 |
| 409 | _Axis (_) lag | Can be caused by insufficient torque (not enough current) or insufficient speed (not enough voltage) on a given axis. Action: check power and cabling between axis motors, drives, and controller for low voltage, noise, or shorts. | §16.4, p.438 |
| 410 | _ axis position error | A position error greater than one motor encoder turn was detected on any axis; all axis motion stops, motor power is released, and the CNC program is aborted. Probable causes: a backwards-wired motor, noise on the motor cables, or an encoder error. Action: jog and watch DRO direction to check for backwards wiring, check motor cabling/grounding, or fast-jog to isolate an encoder error by swapping motors between axes (see manual for the full numbered procedure). | §16.4, p.438 |
| 411 | _ axis full power without motion | 90% Power (a PID Output greater than 115) is applied to an axis with no motion greater than 0.0005 in. for longer than Parameter 61 (default 0.5 sec); all axis motion stops and the CNC program is aborted. Probable causes: a physical stop, a servo drive shutdown from a limit switch input, or the Z-home switch doubling as the Z+ limit switch. Action: slow-jog off a physical stop and set travel limits, check for a tripped limit switch, or check the switch signal for noise (see manual for the full numbered procedure); no motion when jogging toward the error direction indicates a servo drive failure. | §16.4, p.439 |

| 435 | _ axis runaway: Check motor wiring | Motor was in a runaway fault condition; power to the motor is automatically shut off. Action: check the motor wiring. | §16.4, p.440 |
| 436 | Servo drive shutdown | The servo drive hardware detected an overcurrent or overvoltage condition, shown on the drive's LEDs; it stops all motion, removes motor power, and reports the fault to the CNC software via the PLC. Action: on DC systems check the servo drive's LEDs and fibers 4&5; on an AC system check that P178 bit 4 is set. | §16.4, p.440 |
| 437 | Servo power removed | An axis was moving more than 300 RPM while power was supposed to be off, from a backwards-wired motor, a shorted servo drive, or inertia after motion was canceled on an unbalanced axis; power to the motors is released. Action: check the motor wiring, servo drive, or the Kg value in the PID (must not exceed +/-5). | §16.4, p.440 |
| 438 | Spindle slave position error | The slaved axis moved too far in the wrong direction during a spindle-slaved move (such as rigid tapping); job cancelled. Action: check Parameter 34 for an incorrect plus/minus sign in front of the encoder counts. | §16.4, p.440 |
| 439 | _ axis servo drive data output error | Logic power failure or loss of communication from the drive to the MPU11. Action: check that the logic LED is on and the fiber optic cables to the drive; for SD1 drives keep bus cables shielded and short; power down and check drive connections. | §16.4, p.441 |
| 441 | _ axis overvoltage | Input power exceeded 340VDC; the control board shuts down the drive and removes power, and the motor brake engages for five seconds. Action: check that input voltage is below 340VDC; lower the incoming VAC if not. | §16.4, p.441 |
| 442 | _ axis undervoltage | The drive's input power is less than 80VDC. Action: check the supply voltage. | §16.4, p.441 |
| 443 | _ axis commutation encoder bad | The control detected an invalid commutation zone value (0 or 7). Action: perform a motor Move Sync in the Drive Menu; check for a wiring problem in the encoder cable/motor end cap, an encoder cable shield connected at the motor end, a bad encoder, unconnected motor power cable shields, or an improperly grounded drive. | §16.4, p.441 |
| 444 | _ axis overtemperature detected | The drive overtemp sensor was tripped; the motor is not given power. Action: the drive is being run at overcapacity, the cooling fan isn't functioning, or the fan's airflow is blocked. | §16.4, p.441 |
| 445 | _ axis overcurrent detected | Overcurrent is detected on an axis; the motor is not given power. Action: try to jog the axis (the drive resets the current limit and tries to move the motor); if the error returns, check for a short in the motor output. | §16.4, p.441 |
| 446 | _ axis servo drive data input failure | Communication checksum error; the motor is not given power. Action: check the fiber optic cables; verify continuity between the drive chassis, ground strip, and Earth ground. | §16.4, p.441 |

> The manual reuses code 444 for a different message in §16.11 (p.450: `__ modified: __ → __`,
> "A servo drive configuration parameter was modified"). It also reuses code 453 for two
> different messages on the same page (p.442, rows above). Neither reuse is resolved here;
> both are kept as printed.

> The `#__`/`_` placeholder for the limit-switch number is printed inconsistently across
> pages: p.437 prints `Limit (#__) cleared` (capital L, code 340, §16.3), p.438 prints
> `limit (#__) tripped` (lowercase l, code 407, §16.4), and p.438 also prints `_Axis (_) lag`
> (code 409, §16.4, capital A directly after the underscore, no space). Each is kept exactly
