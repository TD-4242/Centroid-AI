# M-code index

Source: Router Manual Ch 13 (§13.1-§13.69, p.280-306).

§13.1 gives a summary of every M-function, pointing to Ch 12-13 for detail (Router Manual
§13.1, p.280-281). §13.2 covers customizing **Most** M-functions 0-90 with an `mfuncXX.mac`
file in `c:\cncr`; M2, M6, and M25 can be customized but always move the Z-axis home before
the macro's commands run, and M0-M9 filenames must use a single digit (`mfunc3.mac`, not
`mfunc03.mac`); no M-function above 90 can be customized with a macro (Router Manual §13.2,
p.281).

> The manual names two of these codes differently in its §1.9 summary than in Ch 13: M30 is
> "M-code for End of Program" there but "Custom M-code" in Ch 13 (Router Manual §1.9, p.15;
> §13.1, p.280; §13.19, p.286). M107 is "Output Binary Coded Decimal Tool Number" there but
> "Output Tool Number" in Ch 13, which does not mention a BCD encoding (Router Manual §1.9,
> p.15; §13.1, p.280; §13.38, p.294).
