# M-series Operator Panel, VCP, and Keyboard Interface

Hardware jog panel controls (§2.1-2.24), Virtual Control Panel (§2.25), keyboard jog panel
(§2.26-2.27), and keyboard shortcut keys (§2.28). Source: Router Manual Ch 2 (Operator Panel).

> Note: control-system behavior for the functions below depends on optional software settings,
> the PLC program, machine parameters, and hardware wiring; the described behavior may not apply
> to every control, or may differ in some respects (Router Manual §2.24, p.21).

The M-series Operator Panel is a sealed membrane keyboard of momentary membrane switches that
controls machine operations and functions; key placement is customizable, and the panel shown
in the manual's figure is representative of a default configuration (Router Manual §2, p.17).

---

## 2.1 Axis Jog Buttons

`X+` `X-` `Y+` `Y-` `Z+` `Z-` `4th+` `4th-` — momentary switches for jogging each of the four
axes, two buttons per axis; only one axis jogs at a time (Router Manual §2.1, p.18).

> Note: the jog buttons do not operate if the M-series CNC software is not running, or while a
> job is running.

## 2.2 Slow/Fast

Labeled with a turtle/rabbit icon in the center of the Axis Motion Controls section (Router
Manual §2.2, p.18). Turtle = slow jog mode; when SLOW is selected (LED on) a jog press moves the
axis at the slow jog rate, otherwise at the fast jog rate. See Ch 15 for setting the fast and
slow jog rates per axis.

## 2.3 Inc/Cont

Toggles between incremental and continuous jogging; LED lit = INC selected (Router Manual §2.3,
p.18). In CONT mode, an axis jog button held down moves the axis continuously until released.

## 2.4 x1, x10, x100

Sets the jog increment amount for incremental jogs and for each MPG handwheel click; only one
increment is active at a time, for all axes together (Router Manual §2.4, p.18):

| Key | Increment |
|---|---|
| x1 | 0.0001" |
| x10 | 0.0010" |
| x100 | 0.0100" |

## 2.5 MPG

Housed in a separate hand-held unit (Router Manual §2.5, p.18). Press `MPG` to make jogging
respond to the MPG handwheel (LED on); select the jog increment and axis, then turn the wheel
slowly. When the LED is off, the MPG is disabled and the jog panel is active.

## 2.6 Single Block

Toggles between auto and single block mode (LED on = single block) (Router Manual §2.6, p.18).
In single block mode, the program runs one line at a time, pressing `CYCLE START` after each
block. Auto mode (the default, LED off) runs the loaded program continuously after `CYCLE
START`; auto mode can be selected at any time while in single block mode, but single block mode
cannot be selected while auto mode is running a program.

## 2.7 Cycle Start

Begins processing the current program at the beginning, then prompts for a second `CYCLE
START` press to begin execution (Router Manual §2.7, p.19). After an M0, M1, M2, or M6, the
message "Press CYCLE START to continue" appears and the control waits for another press.

> **WARNING** Pressing CYCLE START will cause the M-series Control to start moving the axes
> immediately without further warning. Be certain that you are ready to start the program when
> you press this button. Pressing FEED HOLD, E-STOP, or CYCLE CANCEL stops movement if CYCLE
> START is pressed accidentally.

## 2.8 Feed Rate Override

Controls the percentage (0-200%) of the programmed feed rate used during feed-rate cutting moves
— lines, arcs, canned cycles, etc. (Router Manual §2.8, p.19).

> **CAUTION** The Feed Rate Override knob will not work during tapping cycles (G74 and G84).

## 2.9 Feed Hold

Decelerates the current movement to a stop, pausing the running job; `CYCLE START` resumes
motion from the stopped location (Router Manual §2.9, p.19).

> **CAUTION** Feed Hold is temporarily disabled during tapping cycles (G74 and G84) and
> automatic tool changes (M6).

## 2.10 Tool Check

While no program is running, moves the Z-axis to its home/G28 position (Router Manual §2.10,
p.19). While a program is running, aborts it: the control stops normal movement, pulls Z to home,
clears all M-functions, and displays the Resume Job Screen, where tool settings (height/diameter
offsets, etc.) can be changed before resuming with the new tool settings.

## 2.11 Cycle Cancel

Aborts the running program immediately — stops movement, clears all M-functions, and returns to
the Main Screen (Router Manual §2.11, p.19). Press `FEED HOLD` first if possible. After
`CYCLE CANCEL`, resuming requires rerunning the entire program or using the search function
(see Ch 3 or Ch 6).

> §6.3-6.4 (p.83-84) also list `CYCLE CANCEL` as a cancel method whose job can be resumed with
> `F4 – Run` → `F1 – Resume Job`; see [running-jobs.md](running-jobs.md) §6.3-6.4.

## 2.12 Emergency Stop

Releases power to all axes and cancels the current job immediately; also resets certain faults
once the fault condition is fixed or cleared (Router Manual §2.12, p.20).

> **WARNING** On some machines, vertical axes (such as Z and/or W) may start to move due to
> gravity pulling them down when motor power is cut due to EMERGENCY STOP being pressed.

## 2.13 Spindle CW/CCW

Sets the direction the spindle turns when started manually; ignored (program controls direction)
when the spindle starts automatically. Default direction is CW (Router Manual §2.13, p.20).

## 2.14 Spindle Speed +

In Auto Spindle mode, increases speed by 10% of the commanded speed, capped at the lesser of the
maximum speed or 200% of commanded speed (Router Manual §2.14, p.20). In Manual Spindle mode,
increases speed by 5% of maximum speed, up to the maximum. The key's LED lights when speed is
above the 100% point.

## 2.15 Spindle Speed 100%

Sets spindle speed to the 100% point — the commanded speed in Auto mode, or half the maximum
speed in Manual mode; the LED lights at that point (Router Manual §2.15, p.20).

## 2.16 Spindle Speed -

In Auto Spindle mode, decreases speed by 10% of commanded speed, floored at 10% of commanded
speed (Router Manual §2.16, p.20). In Manual mode, decreases by 5% of maximum speed, down to 5%
of maximum. The LED lights when speed is below the 100% point.

## 2.17 Spindle Auto/Man

Toggles the spindle between program control (Automatic, LED lit) and operator control (Manual,
LED off); default is Auto mode (Router Manual §2.17, p.20).

## 2.18 Spin Start

In manual spindle mode, starts the spindle rotating; in automatic mode, restarts the spindle if
it was paused with Spin Stop (Router Manual §2.18, p.21).

## 2.19 Spin Stop

In manual spindle mode, stops the spindle; in automatic mode, pauses spindle rotation, which
Spin Start can then resume (Router Manual §2.19, p.21).

> **NOTICE** The SPIN STOP key should only be pressed during FEED HOLD or when a program is NOT
> running.

## 2.20 Coolant Auto/Manual

Toggles automatic and manual coolant control (Router Manual §2.20, p.21). In automatic mode, M7
(Mist) and M8 (Flood) select coolant from the G-code program. In manual mode, flood and mist are
controlled by their own keys.

> Note: switching from automatic to manual mode turns both flood and mist coolant off
> automatically.

## 2.21 Coolant Flood

In manual coolant mode, toggles flood coolant on/off; the LED lights when flood is selected in
either mode (Router Manual §2.21, p.21).

## 2.22 Coolant Mist

In manual coolant mode, toggles mist coolant on/off; the LED lights when mist is selected in
either mode (Router Manual §2.22, p.21).

## 2.23 Auxiliary Function Keys (AUX1-AUX12)

The jog panel has 12 Auxiliary keys (9 labeled); some may be defined by customized systems
(Router Manual §2.23, p.21).

## 2.24 Notes About Operator Panels

See the callout at the top of this file (Router Manual §2.24, p.21).

## 2.25 VCP Introduction

The Virtual Control Panel (VCP) lets the operator use a mouse and/or touch screen to activate
the CNC Control Operator Interface Panel (Router Manual §2.25, p.22). CNC12 installs the default
Centroid VCP skin automatically; it can be used as-is, or modified per the VCP Manual.

The VCP legend below covers this router build's default skin (Router Manual §2.25, p.22-28):

## 2.26 Keyboard Jog Panel

The PC keyboard can serve as a jog panel; press `ALT+J` to display and enable it (Router
Manual §2.26, p.28-30). Coolant on/off, spindle on/off, feed rate, and spindle override work
without the panel displayed; full functionality, including jogging, needs the panel displayed
on screen. Enabling keyboard jogging itself requires Parameter 170 set to `1` (p.29).

- The status window (upper-right) shows jogging mode (continuous/incremental), incremental step
  size, and jog speed (fast/slow).
- Continuous mode: jog keys move while held, stop on release. Incremental mode: each press moves
  the set increment.
- The jog keys sit in the cursor-key block between the main keyboard and the numeric keypad; a
  key controlling an axis is overlaid with that axis's symbol (X, Y, etc.). They are the Arrow,
  Page Up, and Page Down keys.

Keyboard jog panel keys (Router Manual §2.26, p.30-34):

| Key(s) | Function | Description | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Alt J` | Start/Exit Keyboard Jogging | Invokes or exits the keyboard jogging panel | Always, with few exceptions |
| `Alt S` | Cycle Start | Same as Cycle Start | Always, with few exceptions |
| `Esc` | Cycle Cancel | Same as Cycle Cancel | During a job; otherwise Esc exits menus |
| `Ctrl F1`-`Ctrl F12` | Aux 1-Aux 12 | Executes the function defined to that Aux key; a custom PLC program is required to act on jog panel signals | Always, with few exceptions |
| `Ctrl M` | Toggle Auto Coolant | Toggles coolant mode between auto and manual | Always, with few exceptions |

| `Spacebar` | Feedhold | Enables Feedhold; press Cycle Start to resume | Always, with few exceptions |

> Note: keyboard jogging disables and re-enables itself when leaving and entering the main menu,
> to avoid unexpected movement; it can still be enabled in any menu with `ALT+J` (even after
> being disabled by CNC12) (Router Manual §2.26, p.34).

## 2.27 MDI and the Keyboard Jog Panel

Many keyboard jog panel keys double as MDI commands (Router Manual §2.27, p.34). To use jog
panel functions in MDI, press `ALT+J`; jog, use the handwheels, or use any other jog panel
function, then press `ALT+J` or `Esc` to return to MDI.

---

## 2.28 Keyboard Shortcut Keys

A computer-style keyboard, supplied with most systems, doubles as a jog panel and supplies "hot
keys" usable at almost any time, with few exceptions — some menus may prohibit their use (Router
Manual §2.28, p.34-40).

| Keystroke | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ALT+D` | WCS/Machine Coordinates | Swaps the DRO display between current WCS position and current machine position |
| `ALT+E` | Generate Screenshot | If Parameter 389 > 0, saves a screenshot as `screenshot-nnn.png`; `nnn` starts at 000 and increments per screenshot, resetting on CNC12 restart |
| `ALT+I` | Live PLC I/O | Opens the CNC12 PLC Diagnostic Screen, showing real-time status of all inputs/outputs |
| `ALT+J` | Keyboard Jog Panel | Opens the keyboard jog panel; a window overlays keyboard keys with a VCP-like legend, and a print button prints the panel image |
| `ALT+K` | ATC Bin | Displays the current ATC bin |
| `ALT+L` | ATC Putback Location | Displays the current ATC putback location |
| `ALT+M` | Run MDI | Runs MDI |

| `CTRL+ALT+X` | Go to Shutdown Screen | From the main menu, opens the CNC12 shutdown screen |
| `CTRL+C` | Copy | From a numeric field or WCS Table column, copies the selected value to the clipboard |
| `CTRL+X` | Cut | From a numeric field or WCS Table column, cuts the selected value to the clipboard; the previous value is set to 0 |
| `CTRL+V` | Paste | From a numeric field or WCS Table column, pastes the value from the clipboard |

> Note: `Parameter 389 > 0` gates `ALT+E`'s screenshot action here (Router Manual §2.28.2,
> p.34), while the Machine Parameter index lists Parameters 387-389 as reserved debugging
> parameters that should be left at 0 (Router Manual §15.7.193, p.379; see
> [parameter-index.md](parameter-index.md)). Both are quoted as printed; not reconciled here.

> Note: `CTRL+Q` is assigned to both Spindle Cancel (Router Manual §2.26, p.32; see the keyboard
> jog panel table above) and Probing Cycles History (Router Manual §2.28.20, p.38). Quoted as
> printed; not reconciled here.

> Note: the manual's §2.28.26 heading reads "CTRL+V – Paste," but its body text instructs
> pressing `CTRL+P` to paste (Router Manual §2.28, p.40, both in the same paragraph); this file
> follows the heading's key.

With proper PLC support, `Alt I`'s Live PLC I/O screen also accepts `Ctrl Alt I` to toggle
Inputs 1-80 and `Ctrl Alt F` to toggle outputs (Router Manual §2.28.3, p.35). For the Enhanced
PLC Diagnostics view: open `F7 – Utility`, then `F10 – Acorn Wizard`, select "CNC Control"
under Preferences, and toggle "Enable Simple PLC Diagnostic as default"; then use the Arrow,
`F11`, and `F12` keys to navigate.
