## Symptom -> fix (App B)

**Symptom:** `CNC12 Acorn Communication Time Out` at startup (Acorn Install App B, p.115).

1. Set the Ethernet adapter used for Acorn to a manual IPv4 address `10.168.41.1` / subnet
   `255.255.255.0` (Acorn Install App B, p.115).
2. Allow `CNCM.EXE`/`CNCT.EXE`/`CNCR.EXE` through Windows Defender Firewall for both Public and
   Private networks, or turn the firewall off entirely via Windows Search ->
   `Windows Defender Firewall` -> `Turn Windows Defender Firewall On or Off` (Acorn Install App B,
   p.115-116; `CNCR.EXE` per Acorn Install §3.4, p.26).
3. Uninstall (not just disable) any antivirus/antispyware software — it can slow Acorn
   communication even while allowed to run (Acorn Install App B, p.116).
4. Reboot the CNCPC, power-cycle the Acorn, and restart CNC12, letting any firmware update finish
   (Acorn Install App B, p.116).
5. If it still won't start, update the CNCPC's Ethernet port drivers or try another shielded cable
   (Acorn Install App B, p.116).

> App B (p.115) names only `CNCM.EXE`/`CNCT.EXE` for the firewall allow-list; §3.4 (p.26) also
> lists `cncr.exe`. See [software-setup.md](software-setup.md#windows-1011-configuration) for the
> manual's corporate-policy caveat on anti-virus/firewall software.

## PLC diagnostic screen (App B)

Press `alt+i` from the main program window to open the real-time I/O display. The four arrow
keys move the cursor between the `Inputs`, `Outputs`, `Memory`, and `Stages` rows and within a
row; the highlighted item's definition appears below the last row of LED indicators; active
items are green, inactive are red; `alt+i` exits (Acorn Install App B, p.117). Details:

  fine), but resistive touchscreens are preferred for a CNC console over capacitive ones,
